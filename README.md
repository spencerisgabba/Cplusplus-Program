# Shopping List Program

    
    This project is solving the need for represented data in a quick manner. Using Trie's, C++ can easy traverse and print the data, that's what this project does particularly well.
    
    To further improve this code, you could add readwrite functionality with the .dat file, and you could also probably include the date within the title. 
    
    Writing the Trie was the hardeest part of the program, visualising mapping data onto code is hard when you haven't done it often, but thankfully there's tons of info online.
    
    The trie is also a transferrable skill, this is because they are data structure and algorithm related.
    
    This project is is inline commented for easy readability




    
How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

    Interpreting user needs through user stories is a vital way of quantifying the needs of users and creating well defined parameters for improvement. Gathering raw data doesn't always tell the full story, it's important to quantify these
    user stories into bulleted lists and points which represent the users needs as accurately as possible. IF a user says they would like a change or feature, ask yourself how important that feature is, where that feature would be applied,
    and how long that feature takes to apply

    
How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

    I approach developing programs by making a working wireframe, send that to the client, then begin developing based upon user needs and criticisms of the wireframe. I hope to incorporate more user interaction and better client communication into my Agile
    projects. 
    
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
        
    Being a good team member in software development is about communicating with the team about your pitfalls and acomplishments, helping team members with their work, and being a strong uplifting character other team members can rely upon.
