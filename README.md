# Shopping List Program

    
    This project is solving the need for represented data in a quick manner. Using Trie's, C++ can easy traverse and print the data, that's what this project does particularly well.
    
    To further improve this code, you could add readwrite functionality with the .dat file, and you could also probably include the date within the title. 
    
    Writing the Trie was the hardeest part of the program, visualising mapping data onto code is hard when you haven't done it often, but thankfully there's tons of info online.
    
    The trie is also a transferrable skill, this is because they are data structure and algorithm related.
    
    This project is is inline commented for easy readability
